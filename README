An action can be initialized by a player or imposed by an action card. 
Can we "embed" actions into both cards and selection screens?
Discarding a card and pressing a button would both activate "actions".
There would be different classes of actions.
A very straightfoward one would be draw. Draw happens in one's turn, and in action cards.

Regular UNO adds a skip effect to the action card's draw action, but that can be severed
when generalizing.
